# Xala's Movie Helper

This is a VERY useful [Garry's Mod](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000) tool aimed for helping the film making process in the game.

The addon consists of:
- A lot of important GMod commands that are not included by default in the menus;
- A bunch of new and simple functions.

If someone wants to help me on something, give some advice or send any changes, feel free to do so.

Thanks.
