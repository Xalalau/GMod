Features:
- 3 rendering modes;
- Customization options;
- Duplicator support;
- Ragdoll/NPC support;
- CTRL + Z support;
- Copy/Reload support;
- Well tested with servers.

Known problems:
- GM 12 mode renders entities inside walls and, because of that, they become visible in the Skybox 3D;
- It's not possible to apply colors to Sobel mode;
- The rendering modes don't always work;
- GM 13 mode seems to be more heavy than it should be;
- I still need to correctly clear the duplicator when the player remove the cel shading properties with R key;
