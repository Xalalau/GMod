- Slow down the scenes download (server->client), show the percentage inside the scenes list;
- The "save support" is broken? Test it;
- A better way to know/apply the scenes with multiple actors? Print what is missing?
- Include all the animations (lowercase and what else is missing);
- Include more scenes (Portal 1, 2, ...);
- Fix the umpa etc animations!!!
